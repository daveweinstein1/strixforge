## The Container Hub

Strixforge includes a curated "Container Hub" that allows you to pull pre-built, optimized environments directly into your LXD setup.

**Launch the Hub:**
```bash
strixforge --hub
```

**Available Sources:**
* **kyuz0:** Highly optimized Strix Halo toolboxes (ROCm-7rc, LLaMA-Vulkan, PyTorch-2.5).
* **AMD Official:** Standard AMD-maintained AI containers (ComfyUI-ROCm).
* **Community:** Verified contributions for specific workflows.

## Why Containers?

AI and development tools are **bleeding edge** — ROCm, PyTorch, and AI coding assistants update frequently with breaking changes. We isolate these in LXD containers so:

- **Host stays stable** — Container breakage can't brick your system
- **Instant rollback** — Restore snapshots when experiments fail
- **Fresh starts** — Delete and recreate containers in minutes

## The Origin Story

The name **StrixForge** wasn't chosen by accident. In ancient mythology, the *Strix* was a bird of ill omen, a screeching owl that brought terror in the night. When we first got our hands on the AMD Strix Halo hardware, that's exactly what it felt like. The hardware was a beast, massive unified memory, incredible potential, but the software stack was a nightmare of broken dependencies, kernel panics, and fragmented documentation. It screeched at us every time we tried to run a simple inference, "GGGGGGGGG....", over and over. ;-)

We built this project to silence the screeching. We built it to take the raw, chaotic potential of the "Strix Halo" APU and put it through the Forge, hammering out the imperfections, taming the drivers, and sharpening the software stack until it became a precise, reliable tool.

## Why We Built This

Just a few months ago, the drivers and core libraries were so disjointed that even a seasoned software engineer would give up after a week of frustration and go shopping for a DGX Spark. While there has been significant effort from AMD and others to get the low-level "plumbing" working, the reality on the ground is still a dependency nightmare.

**Strixforge simplifies this chaos in two specific ways:**

1.  **Automated Configuration:** It handles the tedious configuration and installation of all the base packages you need on the host. It applies critical kernel patches (like the Beelink E610 fix) automatically.
2.  **Containerized Safety:** It sets up LXD containers that allow you to leverage the work of elite developers (like `kyuz0`) or to experiment with bleeding-edge software. We help you simple spin up a container so you can safely try out a new app or technology without putting your development machine at risk. If it makes a mess inside the container, your host system remains pristine.

### Who This Is For
This is for the **"People in the Middle."**

You are a developer, a data scientist, or a power user. You know what a tensor is, and you know why you want local inference. But you **don't** want to be a Linux kernel maintainer.
* You want to write code, not debug `make` files.
* You want to run Llama 3 70B, not re-compile LLVM.
* You want the power of Linux without the "Linux tax" on your time.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
* A machine with an AMD Strix Halo (Ryzen AI Max+) processor.
* A fresh installation of **CachyOS** (recommended) or Arch Linux. (more Linux distros coming soon!)
* Secure Boot disabled in BIOS.

**Installation:**
Run this single command to download and launch the installer:

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bit.ly/strixforge | sudo bash
```

This downloads and runs the installer binary from GitHub Releases:
```bash
# What the script does:
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/.../strixforge" -o /tmp/strixforge
chmod +x /tmp/strixforge
/tmp/strixforge "$@"
rm -f /tmp/strixforge
```

View the full script: [install.sh](install.sh)

**Direct download** (no bit.ly):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/daveweinstein1/strixforge/releases/latest/download/strixforge -o /tmp/s && chmod +x /tmp/s && sudo /tmp/s
```

**Installer Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `(none)` | Auto-detects best UI (GUI, then fallback to TUI) |
| `--tui` | Forces Terminal UI |
| `--gui` | Forces Graphical UI (GUI window pops up on localhost) |
| `--auto` | Runs all stages without prompts (Unattended) |
| `--manual` | Interactive stage selection |
| `--hub` | Browse and install community containers (Container Hub) |
| `--check-versions` | Verify package versions |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate without changes |

*Auto-detects GUI if `$DISPLAY` or `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set, otherwise uses TUI.*
